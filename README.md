Summary: 
This report presents a detailed analysis of 2.5 hours of tweets related to Brexit from October 2019, focusing on sentiment, trends, and bot detection. The dataset originally contained 185,944 rows and over 12.8 million columns, which were reduced to 61,934 tweets with 27 meaningful attributes after preprocessing. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed significant tweet activity from personal accounts and prominent media outlets like Reuters and Bloomberg. Sentiment analysis showed 36.15% of tweets were pro-Brexit, 34.19% were against, and 29.66% were neutral. Mapping analysis highlighted a concentration of tweets from the UK and Europe, with limited global engagement. The study identified potential bot activity through anomalies in follower and retweet patterns. While insightful, the analysis is limited by the short timeframe of the dataset, emphasizing the need for extended data to achieve broader conclusions.
